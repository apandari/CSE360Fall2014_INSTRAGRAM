This is a very simple version of Instagram. You can create account using Sign-up. 

Once you have created an account, you can log-in with your username(email) and password. You can upload upto 5 images. 

For the functional testing, when the user makes an account it should store all their informationn into a database. When the same user tries to log into their account it should access the information from the database and allow the user to log in. While in the log in page the user should be able to upload pictures by looking throught he files int he computer.
